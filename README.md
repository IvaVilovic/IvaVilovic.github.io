Welcome to my corner of the universe! I’m Iva Vilović—a physicist deeply intrigued by the wonders of space and an astrobiologist exploring the potential for life beyond our home planet.
As a doctoral scholarship holder in the Astrobiology Research Group at the Technische Universität in Berlin, Germany, specializing in superhabitability research, my focus lies in blending laboratory experiments with theoretical climate-chemistry  modeling. I aim to shed light on the possibilities of life thriving on distant exoplanets orbiting K-dwarf stars.
This website is a portal to my scientific endeavors, research insights, and explorations in astrophysics and astrobiology. Together, let's delve into the awe-inspiring realm of the universe and ponder the profound questions that lie beyond our planet's horizon.

The stunning images on my page portraying our planet’s night sky are all snapshots taken by various artists in different locations across my homeland, Croatia. Enjoy, and come visit!
