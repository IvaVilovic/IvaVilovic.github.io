Studying the atmospheres of planets around K dwarf stars and analyzing their spectral characteristics is crucial to determine if these planets could support life. Despite a planet being potentially [super-habitable](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2019.2161) with abundant life, this life might not be visible in observational data.
I am particularly interested in the intersection of laboratory experiments and theoretical modeling. This drives my goal to blend findings from my lab work involving photosynthetic organisms under simulated K dwarf starlight with theoretical models that portray potential exoplanetary atmospheres. By simulating various changes in both planetary and stellar characteristics linked to superhabitable conditions, I seek to establish the limits of superhabitability and identify observable cues indicating a thriving extraterrestrial biosphere.
Stay tuned to read more on my theoretical work!
