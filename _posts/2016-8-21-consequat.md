When we talk about life outside our planet, it's crucial to understand how life has evolved on Earth over time. Not because we expect potential extraterrestrial life to be just like us, but because we need a benchmark for comparison. Earth is our only known planet where life not only emerged but also spread and really thrived. Our planet has an incredibly intricate mix of different life forms and ecosystems, and each one has left its own mark in our atmosphere and on the surface.
Earth's cycles—like carbon, nitrogen, and water—have shaped our world into a cozy place for life. Studying these cycles helps us figure out if similar processes are happening on other planets out there. Earth has also had some catastrophic periods, with asteroid impacts and volcanic eruptions. Understanding how life bounced back from these events teaches us about its robustness and how it might survive in various conditions.
This is why I studied the Phanerozoic environmental factors, like oxygen levels, global surface temperatures, runoff rates, and carbon dioxide levels, shaping a detectable biosphere. The findings aid understanding of exoplanetary biospheres, guiding our search for extraterrestrial life through space missions and observations.
